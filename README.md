The Expert System Chatbot for Customer Support is an AI-based application designed to automate customer service interactions by providing fast, accurate, and consistent responses. The system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a rule-based expert system to understand user queries, identify intent, extract key entities, and generate logically validated responses. It is built to handle common customer support scenarios such as order tracking, refunds, billing inquiries, account issues, and general FAQs.

The chatbot follows a structured decision-making pipeline in which user input is first processed using NLP techniques to determine intent and confidence levels. The extracted information is then evaluated using a pyDatalog-based rule engine that applies predefined logic rules and escalation policies. If a query is clear and matches an existing rule, the system responds automatically. In cases of ambiguity, missing information, or low confidence, the chatbot safely escalates the query to a human support agent, ensuring reliability and user trust.

The project is implemented in Python using a modular architecture that separates NLP processing, rule-based reasoning, orchestration logic, and response generation. This design makes the system lightweight, explainable, and easy to extend. New intents, rules, or response policies can be added without modifying the core workflow. Although the current implementation uses a command-line interface, it can be easily adapted to web or GUI-based environments.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining NLP with expert system reasoning to build scalable and dependable customer support solutions. While the chatbot is currently rule-driven, it provides a strong foundation for future enhancements such as advanced NLP models, session memory, multilingual support, sentiment analysis, and integration with real-world customer relationship management systems.
